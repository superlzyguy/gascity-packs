# run.sh — entrypoint for the gc-slack-adapter. This is the pack's
# [[service]] proxy_process command, and it also works run by hand in a
# dev checkout.
#
# WHY THE SERVICE COMMAND IS A SCRIPT, NOT THE BINARY: the adapter
# binary is a gitignored build artifact, but `gc import install`
# re-materializes the pack cache GIT-ONLY. When the service command
# points straight at the binary, every pack pin bump wipes it and
# strands the service until a human rebuilds by hand. This script is
# checked in, so it survives every materialization — and when the
# binary is missing it rebuilds it from the sources sitting next to it
# before exec'ing (self-heal, loud logs, idempotent: an existing binary
# is exec'd directly with no build).
#
# Reads secrets from a sourced env file. Default location:
#   ~/.config/gc-slack-adapter/env
# Override via GC_SLACK_ADAPTER_ENV. A missing default is a warning; a
# GC_SLACK_ADAPTER_ENV you set explicitly must exist or startup fails
# (see the env-file block below for why).
#
# Required env keys (in the file):
#   SLACK_WORKSPACE_ID      # T... id, find via Slack admin or auth.test API
#   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN         # xoxb-...
#   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET    # signing secret from Slack app's Basic Information
#   GC_CITY_NAME            # gc city the adapter posts to (matches
#                           # [workspace].name in city.toml). No default —
#                           # adapter exits at startup if unset.
#
# Optional env keys:
#   LISTEN_PUBLIC           # default :8765 (Funnel exposes this; /slack/events)
#   LISTEN_INTERNAL         # default 127.0.0.1:8766 (localhost-only; /publish)
#   INTERNAL_CALLBACK_URL   # default http://127.0.0.1:8766
#   GC_API_BASE_URL         # default http://127.0.0.1:9443
#   ADAPTER_PROVIDER        # default slack
#   REGISTER_ON_START       # default true; set false to skip self-registration

# A defaulted env-file path and one the operator named explicitly are
# different cases and must not fail the same way. A missing default is
# ordinary — supervised deployments often inject the env another way.
# A missing GC_SLACK_ADAPTER_ENV is operator error, and continuing is
# unsafe: the adapter validates that its required keys are *present*,
# never where they came from, so it would boot against whatever Slack
# credentials happen to be in the ambient environment (a decommissioned
# workspace's token in a stale unit file, say) instead of exiting.
#
# SCOPE: this strict rule is service-only. scripts/slack_intake_common.py
# reads the same GC_SLACK_ADAPTER_ENV for the `slack_chat_*` commands and
# treats a missing path as "no env file" (this pack's own suites use that
# idiom), so it stays lenient there. Tightening the command path is a
# separate change — do not assume the variable means the same thing on
# both sides.
#
# ${HOME:-} / ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-}: supervisor environments may not set
# HOME, and set -u must not abort startup over a default we only need
# when GC_SLACK_ADAPTER_ENV is unset. Honors XDG_CONFIG_HOME like the
# README's manual-sourcing instructions do. With neither set, there is no
# usable default at all: the path would degenerate to the root-owned
# /.config/gc-slack-adapter/env, which the operator being handed it
# cannot create. Leave it empty so no message can offer that path.
